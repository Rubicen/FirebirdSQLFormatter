# FirebirdSQLFormatter
Is a formatter for Firebird SQL - it current does not work, is more of an alpha version

Still trying to decide whether to progress using separation of the single elements and processing it in a "smart way" or to just force it using some generic checks. First option is more editable, more customization, and maintainable. Second option is a quick way to be able to mostly format the SQL.

The general goal of this is to be able to turn messy semi-formatted Firebird SQL into readable code - doesn't have to be perfect but will make it easier to read at least. Final build will hopefully be something a bit more exact and extendable to user needs.
